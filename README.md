# Computer Graphics Project: Hunting Game 
### Harry Foley & Marcello Grati

Idea: simple 3D animal hunting game.
User is contained in a small area in some part of the map. 
User has a rifle, can choose between not aiming with scope or aiming with scope.
Shoot animals that pop up around the map to score points.

#### Starting Point: 
- build out from this repo, based on A10
- have a simple flat square map/world, with some rocks and trees on it
- have some animals placed around the map
- use the basic blinn shader provided in A10 first, rewrite later and add additional shaders as needed
- limit user movement control from fly to walk
- get FPV view with gun, including on screen crosshair
- user should be on some platform in middle of map, unable to leave platform
- find library for basic collision detection, needed primariliy to do the shooting

#### Nice to haves:
- Shadows
- Gun Smoke
- Animation for animal hit
- Day and Night Lighting from a Sun and Moon that orbit the map
