# Computer Graphics Project: Hunting Game 
### Harry Foley & Marcello Grati

Idea: simple 3D animal hunting game.

The goal of the game is to hunt all of the animals inside of the map in the time given.
The user is free to roam around the map, trying to find them all and shooting at them with its rifle.
Aiming can be done with or without a scope, and during the night a torch can be activated to improve the visibility

#### Nice to haves:
- Shadows
- Gun Smoke
- Animation for animal hit
